# 3D-Connect-4
A 3D Connect 4 game (4x4x4) implemented in Java, featuring an interactive Player vs. AI mode with a simple yet effective AI. My early exploration into AI development.
This repository contains a 3D Connect 4 game implemented in Java, featuring a 4x4x4 grid. The game includes:

-Player vs. AI mode: Play against a simple yet effective AI designed to provide a challenging experience.

-Player vs. Player mode: Enjoy a dynamic and engaging version of the classic Connect 4 game in a three-dimensional space with your friends.

This project represents my early steps into the world of AI, showcasing fundamental techniques for building a decision-making agent in a game environment by point system. The AI is hard to beat but not impossible. If you manage to beat the AI, feel free to share an image of your victory with me! Feedback and contributions are welcome!
